# PersonaChat with GPT2 Example

In this example, we will use a set of components from the `visuallm` library to create a dataset explorer, an open-ai like generation with possibilities of adjusting various generation parameters, a next token prediction explorer with the visualisation of the softmax, and a chat application.

The application can be started by running:

```sh
flask --app examples_py.persona_chat_example.app run
```
