# Language Model Generation
- when evaluating language models it is often pain to see what is generated and why
- this little package is a `vue.js` frontend together with `flask` backend and it is designed to easily show the distribution of the next token prediction

## Installation
- right now only installation right from the git is supported, however I plan to deploy the package also to PyPi
- `pip install git+https://github.com/gortibaldik/visualize_llm_generation#egg=llm_generation_server`
