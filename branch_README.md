# Goals of This Branch

I want to create a chat component which would allow me to chat with the model

Challenges: - do it in a way that interacts well with all the current components

## Decisions

During the chat the following elements must be resolved:

- how does the input change in accordance to the input provided by the user and in accordance to the output generated by the model
  - this is a component level decision, nothing needs to be added regarding the elements
- how does the user enter the input ?
  - this needs a new text input element
  - the element needs to be as thin as possible, without any larger chunk of functionality around it

## TODO

- showcase in the README :heavy_check_mark:
- styling of the frontend element :heavy_check_mark:
- possibility of multiline text input ? :heavy_check_mark:
- implicit enter :heavy_check_mark:
